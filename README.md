The queries shared in this section were created as reference examples for those who want to develop alerting and reporting mechanisms in Splunk. 

The fields used in the queries (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) may vary depending on the type of logs being collected (Windows Event Log, syslog, etc.).

Some queries may require Data Models (e.g., Network_Traffic, etc.). To view these, you can run the '| datamodel' SPL command or check them by going to Settings -> Data Models in the interface.
